# The Strength Forge Gym

User-Centric Frontend Development milestone project for Code Institute.
This is a fictitious gym website created for the purpose to demonstrate both potential future employers and tutors skills acquired during my study at Code Institute. The site consists of six sections where various technologies were used.

# Demo
A live demo can be found [here:](https://pilecki.github.io/The-Strength-Forge).

# UX

The purpose of the site is attracting new customers as well as provide to existing gym members information about fitness classes schedule available to the gym. 

A primary aim in creating the design was the simplicity of the form so that the potential customer could only focus on the essential features of the product. I used as less as possible elements to obtain such an effect.
The website is divided into sections which are: home, join, about, gym, classes and a footer.
1. On top of the page, a fixed navigation bar is placed, giving a user easy access to every part of the site.

2. The Home section consists of a picture of the muscular man and a text that encourages people to hard work.

3. The Join section provides a simple form to contact the staff of the gym and make any queries.

4. In the about section, there is a warm welcome and information about the location of the gym as well as brief descriptions of the training areas.

5. The gym section contains photos, allowing customers to familiarise with the main amenities available in the gym.

6. In the classes section, there are pictures with descriptions of the classes available in the gym.

7. The footer includes address links to social media sites running by the gym and a large link leading to join us section.

# Technologies
HTML, CSS, Bootstrap

# Features

The site uses the navbar feature provided by the Bootstrap framework, which is responsive regardless of what device user use. Additionally, on small screens, the navbar remains collapsed, making design clear and user-friendly.

In WebKit browsers, such as Chrome, Safari and Opera, the look of the browser's scrollbar was modified, providing pleasing to the eye effect harmonising with rest colours on the website.

## Features left to implement

In the future, I would like to add responsive fitness schedule using JavaScript in the classes section.

Also using JavaScript, I would like to implement navbar, which changes its background colour depending on the what background it is placed.

# Testing

A website was manually tested on various mobile devices(iPhone5,6,7, Ipad, Fire 10 HD, Samsung Galaxy, Sony Xperia) and multiple web-browsers (Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, Internet Explorer, Edge, Safari) to ensure compatibility and responsiveness.
During testing, I noticed incompatibility of background-image-attachment-fixed property on Appleâ€™s devices. The image was enlarged and blurry making an inaesthetic look. To fix it the attachment-fixed property was changed to scroll.

All links on the website work very well. Each link leads to the desired location. The Download, Facebook, Twitter and Youtube links open in a new tab.  

The required attribute is set for all input fields, preventing sending the form with empty fields. Also, due to define the type of data that have to be placed inside the input field, the user is forced to submit correct information.

# Deployment

The website is published using hosting service GitHubPages taking files straight from a repository on GitHub. The site is updated automatically after new commits.
To store site locally use can either use Github Desktop or clone it using the following command: git clone https://github.com/ pilecki/The-Strength-Forge.git.
